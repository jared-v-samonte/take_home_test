The input data is a JSON file that contains an array of 2-D line segments. Some line segments may be merged: they are parallel and share an endpoint. 

There are two tasks: 
* Find all merge-able lines from the original [1-split.json](test/assets/1-split.json) file and merge them. We have provided some boilerplate code/project files to get you started.
* Write a separate python script that take in the original [1-split.json](test/assets/1-split.json) along with the solution output from your code and visualize the lines on two graphs. You may use any open source Python or C++ library.
